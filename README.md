### Main Submodules
- **datasets** - Code to load example ECG signal quality datasets, including the The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011 Dataset and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
- **sqis** - Functions that calculate signal quality indicies on time-series signals. Most implementations are focused on ECG quality, as it is a common area of research.
- **featurization** - Contains functions that calculate geometric waveform features of Pleth and ECG.
